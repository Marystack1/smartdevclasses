            Reasons why i want to study Cybersecurity
        </h2>

   
    <p>
        Looking at my interest , i love anything that has to do with coding.
        Cybersecurity is a broad course, and looking at the general knowledge of cyber security,
        they are known for protecting the internet against unauthorised attack.
        I am going to make that the internet is well secured from any external attack.
